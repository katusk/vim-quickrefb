Vim Quick Reference for Beginners
=================================

This vim quick reference for beginners is mostly based on the first three chapters of the excellent German introductory feature round-up book "vim 7.3 GE-PACKT --- vi improved" by Reinhard Wobst (4th Edition 2012, mitp-Verlag).

The reference was written in LyX. You can find the rendered vim-quickrefb.pdf output under the "releases" tab here on github. Feel free to send me your suggestions, comments, and any kind of feedback.
